# calorie-calc
Final Project for Harvard Extension School JS Course

This is a web application that takes 2 input, the name of the food and the amount in grams, and makes two AJAX calls to USDA API's. As a result, the total calorie is printed to the page.

For example: if you want to know the amount of calories in 10g of 1% lowfat milk with added vitamins A and D, then you need to type "milk" and "10" to the two input fields, then select "Milk, lowfat, fluid, 1% milkfat, with added nonfat milk solids, vitamin A and vitamin D" from the list. Finally, you will see the output is 4.3 Calories.
